classlojure lets you easily create a classloader with an alternate classpath and evaluate
clojure forms in it. This classloader can even use a different version of clojure than
your primary classloader.

## Usage

    (use 'classlojure.core)

    (def clojure-13 (classlojure "file:clojure-1.3.0-alpha2-SNAPSHOT.jar"))

    (eval-in clojure-13 '*clojure-version*)
    ;; {:interim true, :major 1, :minor 3, :incremental 0, :qualifier "alpha2"}

    (eval '*clojure-version*)
    ;; {:major 1, :minor 2, :incremental 0, :qualifier ""}
